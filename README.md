## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1️⃣ Credit Cards ETL Project
**Description:** This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for credit card data using Informatica Data Engineering Integration and Oracle SQL. The ETL pipeline reads data from multiple source tables, applies transformations, and loads it into target tables with business rules such as data masking, filtering, and surrogate key generation.
- 📌 **Technologies Used:** Informatica Data Engineering Integration and Oracle SQL.

### 2️⃣ ETL Pipeline for Data Warehouse (DWH) with Slowly Changing Dimensions
**Description:** This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for loading data from a source system into a staging area (STG) and then into a Data Warehouse (DWH). The DWH is designed with best practices, ensuring that:
Fact tables are stored as daily snapshot tables to maintain historical transaction data.
Dimension tables are implemented as Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2, preserving historical changes in customer and product information.
Staging area holds 7 daily snapshots, allowing for historical tracking and auditing before data moves to the DWH.
- 📌 **Technologies Used:** SQL Server, Oracle and Informatica Data Engineering Integration.
